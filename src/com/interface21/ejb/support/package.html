<html><body>Superclasses to make implementing EJBs simpler and less error-prone,as well as guaranteeing a Spring BeanFactory is availableto EJBs. This promotes good practice, with EJB services usedfor transaction management, thread management, and (possibly) remoting,while business logic is implemented in easily testable POJOs.<br>In this model, the EJB is a facade, with as many POJO helpers behindthe BeanFactory as are required.<br>	The classes in this package are discussed in Chapter 11 of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1861007841/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).The present version has changed somewhat, but has the same goals.<p>Note that the default behaviour is to look for an EJB enviroment variablewith name <code>ejb/BeanFactoryPath</code> that specifies thelocation <i>on the classpath</i> of an XML bean factory definitionfile (such as <code>/com/mycom/mypackage/mybeans.xml</code>.If this JNDI key is missing, your EJB subclass won'tsuccessfully initialize in the container.</body></html>
