<!--
	Spring XML BeanFactory DTD.
	Author: Rod Johnson
	
	This defines a simple and consistent way of creating a namespace
	of JavaBeans configured by a Spring XmlBeanFactory.
	
	This document type is used by most Spring functionality, including
	web application contexts, which are based on BeanFactories.
	
	Each <bean> element in this document defines a JavaBean.
	Typically the bean class is specified, along with JavaBean
	properties.
	
	References among beans are supported (setting a JavaBean
	property to refer to another bean in the same factory).
	
	Bean instances can be "singletons" (shared instances)
	or "prototypes" (independent instances).
	
	There is also support for lists, maps, and 
	java.util.Properties types.
	
	As the format is simple, a DTD is sufficient, and there's
	no need for a schema at this point.

<!-- 
	The document root.
	At least one bean definition is required.
-->

<!ELEMENT beans (
        bean+
)>

<!--
	Defines a single named bean.
-->
<!ELEMENT bean (
        property*
)>

<!--
	All beans are identified by an id, to enable reference checking.
	There are constraints on a valid XML id: if you want to reference
	your bean in Java code using a name that's illegal as an XML id,
	use the optional "name" attribute.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean id ID #REQUIRED>

<!-- 
	Each bean definition must specify the FQN of the class,
	or the name of the parent bean from which the class can be worked out.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean class CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST bean parent CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- 
	Optional attribute for the name of the custom initialization method
	to invoke after setting bean properties. The method must have no arguments,
	but may throw any exception. 
-->
<!ATTLIST bean init-method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional attribute for the name of the custom destroy method to invoke
	on bean factory shutdown. The method must have no arguments,
	but may throw any exception. Note: Only invoked on singleton beans!
-->
<!ATTLIST bean destroy-method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Is this bean a "singleton" (one shared instance, which will
	be returned by all calls to getBean() with the id),
	or a "prototype" (independent instance resulting from each call to
	getBean(). Default is singleton.

	Singletons are most commonly used, and are ideal for multi-threaded
	service objects.
	
	Todo default=true 
-->
<!ATTLIST bean singleton CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Optional. Can be used to create an alias
	illegal in an id.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean name CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Bean definitions can have zero or more properties. 
	Property elements correspond to JavaBean setter methods exposed
	by the bean classes. Spring supports primitives, references to other
	beans in the same or related factories, lists, maps and properties.
-->
<!ELEMENT property (
        (value | ref | list | map | props)
)>

<!--
	The property name attribute is the name of the JavaBean property.
	This follows JavaBean conventions: a name of "age" would correspond
	to setAge()/optional getAge() methods.
-->
<!ATTLIST property name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Defines a reference to another bean in this factory or an external
	factory (parent or included factory). 
-->
<!ELEMENT ref EMPTY>

<!--
	Contains a string representation of a property value.
	The property may be a string, or may be converted to the
	required type using the JavaBeans PropertyEditor
	machinery. This makes it possible for application developers
	to write custom PropertyEditor implementations that can
	convert strings to objects. 
	
	Note that this is recommended for simple objects only.
	Configure more complex objects by setting JavaBean
	properties to references to other beans.
-->
<!ELEMENT value (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
	References must specify the id of the target bean.
	Internal references, using
	the "bean" attribute, can be checked by this DTD,
	thus should be preferred for references within the same
	bean factory XML file.
	External references must use the "external" attribute and can
	be checked only at runtime.
-->
<!ATTLIST ref bean IDREF #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST ref external CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	A list can contain multiple value and/or ref elements.
	Java lists are untyped, pending generics support in Java 1.5. 
	although references will be strongly typed. 
	A list can also map to an array type. The necessary conversion
	is automatically performed by the Spring AbstractBeanFactory. 
-->
<!ELEMENT list (
        (value | ref)*
)>

<!--
	A Spring map is a mapping from a string key to 
	object.
	Maps may be empty.
-->
<!ELEMENT map (
        (entry)*
)>

<!--
	A map entry can be a value, ref or list
	The name of the property is given by the "key" attribute.
-->
<!ELEMENT entry (
        (value | ref | list)*
)>

<!ATTLIST entry key CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
	Props elements differ from map elements in that values must be strings.
	Props may be empty.
-->
<!ELEMENT props (
        (prop)*
)>

<!--
	Element content is the string value of the property. The "key"
	attribute is the name of the property.
-->
<!ELEMENT prop
        (#PCDATA)
>

<!--
	Each property element must specify the key. The value
	is the element content.
-->
<!ATTLIST prop key CDATA #REQUIRED>
